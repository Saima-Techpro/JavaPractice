    /*
    In Java, the FullTimeEmployee class inherits from the Employee class.
    The Employee class has a protected double salary attribute. Since FullTimeEmployee is a subclass of Employee,
    it inherits this salary field from the parent class.

     This means that even though FullTimeEmployee does not declare a salary variable explicitly, it has access to
     the salary field through inheritance.
     this.salary refers to the inherited salary:

     The 'this' keyword in Java refers to the current instance of the class (in this case, an instance of FullTimeEmployee).
     Since FullTimeEmployee inherits the salary field from Employee, this.salary is a reference to the salary field
     in the Employee class, not in FullTimeEmployee itself.
     The assignment this.salary = salary; ensures that the salary field inherited from Employee gets initialized
     with the value passed into the FullTimeEmployee constructor.
