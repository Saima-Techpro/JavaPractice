Create a program to manage different types of employees
(full-time, part-time, manager, intern, and contract employees).
Each employee type has specific attributes and salary calculation rules.
The system should be able to calculate the total salary for each employee based on their role and conditions.

General Requirements:

The program should allow creating employees with attributes such as name, ID, and salary-related details.
Each employee type has different attributes and salary calculation methods:

Full-Time Employees: Have a base salary, bonus, and benefits.
Part-Time Employees: Earn based on hourly rate and hours worked.
Managers: Inherit from Full-Time Employees, with additional managerial perks.
Interns: Receive a fixed stipend for a specific duration.
Contract Employees: Are paid based on contract rate and contract length.

Conditions:

1. The system must validate employee data (name, ID, salary) to ensure they are valid.
   If any invalid data is entered (e.g., negative salary), the system should provide an error message: "Invalid data entered!".
2. The system should allow calculating and displaying the total salary for each employee type.

Each employee type has specific salary rules:

Full-Time Employees: Salary is calculated as base salary + bonus + benefits.
Part-Time Employees: Salary is calculated as hourly rate * hours worked.
Managers: In addition to the full-time salary, managers should receive a 10% bonus for their managerial role.
Interns: Receive a fixed stipend.
Contract Employees: Salary is calculated as contract rate * contract length.

Discounts and Additional Conditions:

Managerial Bonus: Managers receive an additional 10% bonus on top of their full-time salary.
Part-Time Hours: Part-time employees can only work between 1 and 40 hours per week.
                 If more than 40 hours is entered, display a warning message: "Invalid number of hours entered!".
Intern Duration: Interns can only have a maximum internship period of 12 months.
                 If more than 12 months is entered, display a warning message: "Invalid internship duration!".
Contract Length: Contract employees can have contracts of up to 24 months.
                 If the contract length exceeds 24 months, display a warning: "Invalid contract length!".

Output: The system should display the calculated salary and details for each employee type,
        including any applied conditions or warnings based on input data.


Notes:
Each class uses encapsulation to protect employee data and provides methods to access them safely.
Polymorphism is demonstrated with the calculateSalary() method, which behaves differently for each type of employee.
Inheritance is used to extend the behavior of the base Employee class into different types of employees.
The system also implements validation checks, printing error messages when invalid data is entered.
This implementation covers the entire system and satisfies the requirements for inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
